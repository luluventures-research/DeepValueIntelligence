**Instruction to AI:**
Please execute a "God Mode" deep financial research report on company **[INSERT TICKER/NAME]**.

## I. Executive Summary & Variant Perception
* **The Elevator Pitch:** Summarize the business model in plain English.
* **The Consensus View:** What does the market currently believe? (e.g., "High growth AI play").
* **The Variant Perception (Alpha):** What is the market missing? (e.g., "Hidden pricing power," "Obscured earnings power due to temporary capex").
* **Earnings Tone Analysis:** Analyze the subtext of the latest earnings call. Is management confident, defensive, or promotional?

---

## II. Circle of Competence & Business "First Principles"
### 1. The Money Machine (Business Model)
* **Revenue Breakdown:** Draw a Pie Chart of income sources with proportions.
* **Unit Economics:** What is the average price per unit/subscription?
* **Recurring vs. Transactional:** What % of revenue is high-quality recurring revenue?
* **Customer Concentration:** Does any client >10% of revenue? (Fragility check).

### 2. Hamish’s Moat Analysis (The Durability Test)
*Identify if the company possesses specific "Hamish-Style" moats:*
* **Counter-positioning:** A business model incumbents cannot copy without self-cannibalization.
* **Switching Costs:** Quantifiable pain/cost for customers to leave.
* **Scale Economies Shared:** Evidence of passing scale benefits to customers to widen the moat.
* **Intangible Assets:** Brands, patents, or regulatory licenses that allow pricing power.
* **Network Effects:** Does the service improve mathematically as more users join?

### 3. The Capital Cycle (Industry Supply Side)
* **Capital Flux:** Is capital flooding in (bad for returns) or fleeing (good for incumbents)?
* **Industry Structure:** Fragmented, Oligopoly, or Monopoly?
* **Rivalry:** Is the industry rational or engaged in a price war?

---

## III. Forensic Financial Analysis (Quality of Earnings)
*Audit the numbers. Don't just report them.*

### 1. Cash Flow Reality Check
* **SBC Adjustment:** Calculate `FCF minus Stock-Based Compensation`. (Tech companies often inflate FCF by paying employees in stock; treat this as a cash expense).
* **CapEx vs. Depreciation:** Is CapEx consistently lower than Depreciation? (Are they under-investing in assets to flatter earnings?).
* **Cash Flow For Owners (CF40):** Calculate Hamish’s metric: `Cash Flow From Ops - Maintenance CapEx`.

### 2. The Shenanigans Test (Red Flags)
* **DSO Divergence:** Are "Days Sales Outstanding" (receivables) growing faster than Revenue? (Channel stuffing risk).
* **Inventory Bloat:** Is "Days Sales Inventory" rising? (Products not selling).
* **Goodwill Risk:** Is Goodwill > 50% of Total Assets?

---

## IV. Management & Incentives (The Agency Problem)
### 1. The "Skin in the Game" Audit
* **Ownership:** Do executives own a significant portion of their wealth in stock?
* **Compensation Structure:** Are they paid on **ROIC** (Good) or just **Revenue/EPS** (Bad)?
* **Insider Activity:** Net Buy/Sell ratio in the last 12 months.

### 2. The "Scuttlebutt" (Soft Data)
* **Employee Sentiment:** Glassdoor rating trends (Happy engineers = better products).
* **Customer Sentiment:** Trustpilot/NPS score trends.

---

## V. Munger’s Inversion (The Pre-Mortem)
* **The Obituary (2035):** Imagine it is 10 years in the future and the company has failed. Write the "autopsy" explaining *how* it died (e.g., "Debt wall," "Tech obsolescence").
* **Anti-Moat:** What specific trend is "Kryptonite" to this business?

---

4.  **Fortress Balance Sheet:** Debt-to-Equity < 0.5? Interest Coverage ≥ 3x?
5.  **Moat Evidence:** Gross Margin > 40%? ROIC ≥ 12% (10yr avg)?

---

## VIII. Valuation (The Price You Pay)
### 1. Reverse DCF (Market Expectations)
* **Question:** What growth rate is the current stock price implying? (Set Discount Rate to 10%, Terminal to 3%, solve for Growth).
* **Verdict:** Is this implied growth easy to hurdle?

### 2. Hamish/Buffett DCF Model
* **Input:** Use `Cash Flow For Owners (CF40)` (Operating Cash Flow - Maintenance CapEx).
* **Scenarios:**
    * *No-Growth (Bear):* 0% growth.
    * *Conservative (Base):* Lowest FCF growth of past 10 yrs.
    * *Nominal (Bull):* 10yr Average FCF growth (capped at 15%).
* **Constraints:** Terminal Growth strictly < 3%. Discount Rate 10-15%.
